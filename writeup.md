## Protein Crystal Preparation

### Available structures

There are 4 pdb structures that are deposited to protein data bank as the result of the Rama's paper:
 - 5e11 (obtained at 289K with no E field - two alternative conformations A and B)
 - 5e22 (obtained at 289K with E field - two alternative conformations A and B as well as two assymetric units)
 - 5e21 (obtained at 277K with no E field - one single conformation)
 - 5e1y (obtained at 277K with no E field - three alternative conformations A, B and C (for only one residue))

Two structures at 277 where obtained at the other facility by other people... They were used a reference to refine structures during EFX experiment, which are obtained at 289K (15C)

Note: Laue crystallography  - is the process when a stationary crystal is illuminated by a polychromatic X-Ray beam.
Regular crystallography - is when the moving crystall is illuminated by a monochromatic beam of X-Rays.
